# Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes customer churn and retention patterns in the banking sector. It focuses on understanding customer behavior, account activity, and product usage through structured data modeling and analytical visualizations.

---

## Project Objective
To design a three-page Power BI dashboard that converts raw banking data into meaningful insights by applying effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visual storytelling.

---

## Key Highlights
- Developed a **Star Schema** data model connecting six dimension tables with a central fact table.
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and verifying numeric consistency.
- Created calculated columns and DAX measures such as Retention Rate, Average Balance, and Average Salary.
- Designed three interactive report pages:
  1. **Customer Overview** – Customer demographics, balance distribution, and key performance indicators.
  2. **Churn Analysis** – Retention and exit breakdowns by geography, gender, and tenure.
  3. **Product and Credit Insights** – Product usage patterns, credit card adoption, and retention trends.
- Applied a dark-themed layout with slicers and consistent visual hierarchy for clear data communication.

- Middle-aged customers exhibit higher retention rates compared to other groups.  
- Credit card holders tend to remain more loyal to the bank.  
- The analysis helps visualize the customer journey from active to inactive and exited states, supporting data-driven retention strategies.
